# employeeTracker
We wanted to create a command-line app that can be used to manage a company's employee database. We wanted to use inquirer to prompt the user to answer questions. The user can run the application and is presented with a prompt to select among various options within the company's database. When the user runs the application they can choose which option they would like to do from a list of choices.
